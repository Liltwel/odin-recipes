# odin-recipes

An extremely basic HTML site with a few different desert recipes.

I was able to take the lessons from the Odin Project and use the knowledge to create a bare bones cookbook style website. This project was my first foray into HTML and thus was a big stepping stone in going from clueless to a little less so. 

This project taught me how the basics of creating webpages and adding text, images and hyperlink elements to them. Finally stitching them all together to create a flow-able path through the site.
